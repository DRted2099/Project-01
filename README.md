# Project-01

This is simulation was run on MATLAB.

Change the path of the .xslx file to the path saved on your computer when running the code. Make changes to lines that are commented with "Import the data"

All the data used in the code is extracted from the excel file.

The code simulates the production lines of 4 parts. It also plots bar graphs of :

1. Average Cycle Times for each product Line
2. Average Time taken by each machine 
3. Number of times a machine fails
4. Reliability of each machine
5. Wait times of each machine
6. Number of breakdowns of each machine
7. Reliability of the whole line (series reliability)
8. Cost comparision of each workstation

The last section of the script consists of custom functions that generates breakdown time, cycle time and set-up time for each of the machines
